# minecraft-backup-uploader
Discord bot that automates the uploading and logging of backups to a specific text channel.

# Warning!
This bot was made in an hour for me and a couple of mates for our Minecraft server it doesn't take usability or scalability into mind.

# Instructions
1. Create a Discord application and bot.
2. Replace DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN with your Bot's token.
3. Replace DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID with the ID of the channel you want the backups to be sent in.
4. Replace all MINECRAFT_RCON_* variables with your Server's RCON information.
5. Assuming you have a backup mod/plugin already installed on your server replace MINECRAFT_BACKUP_COMMAND with your backup command and replace MINECRAFT_BACKUP_DIRECTORY with the directory where they're saved to.
